Milestones...

xI   Register a sensor to the database
    - include current state and pertinent info

xII  Set desired state in database and have sensor update
    - will include having sensor periodically polling app

xIII Create API on sensor for on-demand state changing

IV  Create Local Gateway to Display Sensors and State



Things to work out...
todo - Figure out new sensor registration to account/site...

done    - add sensor_type and port_type into the registration functions on the app server
        - will need to look at the functions being called from the sensor to align parameters

done - Figure out why Web Browsers aren't getting responses accurately... not cleanly closing the sessions I think...

done -  Memory management
        x use fixed CHAR[] for part_num and port_num
        x use the free-ram to monitor
        x move the info string output to be straight to write

done -  Ethernet Module update
        x Process the new returned values to flip
        x part of desired state activation
        x change the response to any request to be the json info format
        x no more toggle or set function, basically just look for the ? and process the string

done    - Wireless client crashes when app_server down

done    - Wired client - DNS lookup

todo    - Error checking/recovery at startup if the DB is down
        - if DB found down, need to reinitialize the DB connection otherwise when it comes up, app still down

todo    - Periodic checking of the DB connection.  If it fails after starting, the app server shoud notice and do something

todo hw   - add in mDNS into the sensors for Bonjour location finding

todo hw   - leverage milliseconds for timing rather than a counter

todo    - convert the db calls to return a descriptive dictionary rather than a list/tuple
in process

todo    - data seems to be saved in the database connection so if something changes outside of the python program it doesnt' learn
        - example... change the state_override value on a sensor and then try to sensor.load() again, it doesn't get new value

todo    - recall how to make something iterable... Sensor, Port and Site all need to become iterable
