Milestones...

xI   Register a sensor to the database
    - include current state and pertinent info

xII  Set desired state in database and have sensor update
    - will include having sensor periodically polling app

xIII Create API on sensor for on-demand state changing

IV  Create Local Gateway to Display Sensors and State



Things to work out...
todo - Figure out new sensor registration to account/site...

done    - add sensor_type and port_type into the registration functions on the app server
        - will need to look at the functions being called from the sensor to align parameters

done - Figure out why Web Browsers aren't getting responses accurately... not cleanly closing the sessions I think...

done -  Memory management
        x use fixed CHAR[] for part_num and port_num
        x use the free-ram to monitor
        x move the info string output to be straight to write

done -  Ethernet Module update
        x Process the new returned values to flip
        x part of desired state activation
        x change the response to any request to be the json info format
        x no more toggle or set function, basically just look for the ? and process the string

done    - Wireless client crashes when app_server down

done    - Wired client - DNS lookup

todo    - Error checking/recovery at startup if the DB is down
todo    - Periodic checking of the DB connection.  If it fails after starting, the app server shoud notice and do something
