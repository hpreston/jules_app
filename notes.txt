Milestones...

I   Register a sensor to the database
    - include current state and pertinent info

II  Set desired state in database and have sensor update
    - will include having sensor periodically polling app

III Create API on sensor for on-demand state changing

IV  Create Local Gateway to Display Sensors and State



Things to work out...
todo - Figure out new sensor registration to account/site...

todo    - add sensor_type and port_type into the registration functions on the app server
        - will need to look at the functions being called from the sensor to align parameters

todo - Figure out why Web Browsers aren't getting responses accurately... not cleanly closing the sessions I think...
